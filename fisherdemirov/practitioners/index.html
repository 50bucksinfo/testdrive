<h1>Dr. George Demirov</h1>

<p><strong>WHY DID YOU BECOME AN OSTEO?</strong><br />
I was injured playing football as a teenager.  I’d tried several traditional rehabilitation methods which didn’t help, so I tried osteopathy.  It was so effective it inspired me to peruse a career in osteopathy and I haven’t looked back (pardon the pun) since</p>


<p><strong>SO YOU SPEND A BIT OF TIME AT THE RACING TRACK…?</strong><br />
Absolutely! I apply osteopathic techniques to race horses under the Aquanita Racing Group. I love being able to combine my love of the races with osteopathy, assisting race horses to fast track their rehabilitation and prolong their racing career.</p>


<p><strong>HOW DID YOU START UP FISHER DEMIROV?</strong><br />
I graduated from RMIT in 2004 with a double degree in Bachelor of Applied Science and Bachelor of Applied Osteopathic Science and shortly after started working under Dr. Rachael Fisher in Vermont.  A few years on (and few kids more for Rach) I was fortunate to be offered a joint partnership with Rach in Ringwood in 2008.</p>


<p><strong>IN YOUR SPARE TIME YOU…</strong><br />
I’m a keen sportsman which I’ve inherited through my Dad who happens to be an ex-wrestler. Anything to do with football (GO HAWKS!), wrestling, the races, cricket and tennis. Weekends are spent with the wife, dog, family and friends.</p>


<p><strong>SOME FUN FACTS ABOUT YOU…</strong><br />
My hands appeared in a workcover TV commercial and I appeared as a wrestling referee on Neighbours!</p>

<h1>Dr. Rachael Fisher</h1>

<p><strong>WHY DID YOU BECOME AN OSTEO?</strong><b><br />
</b>As a child I loved sport and in particular squash playing every spare minute I could.  I had my fair share of injuries and tried many different types of treatment. In my late teens I tried what I thought was a ‘new’ modality called Osteopathy which helped me the most and sparked my interest in becoming an Osteo.</p>


<p>I began studying in 1993.  Because it Osteopathy was not well known back then (it is actually one of the oldest forms of manual therapy) I was frequently met with questions and comments such as “What’s that?” or “Does that mean you study bones?”</p>


<p>I graduated in 1997 with a Bachelor of Applied Science and Bachelor of Clinical Science (Osteopathy) from a class of 19 at RMIT which was the only Osteo course in Australia and New Zealand at the time.  When people now ask about my occupation almost everyone says “I see an Osteopath!”</p>


<p><strong>HOW DID YOU START UP FISHER DEMIROV?</strong><b><br />
</b>After graduating I began working at a multi disciplinary clinic in the Eastern Suburbs in addition to Bendigo Osteopathic Clinic where patients would travel over 100kms to see their Osteo!</p>


<p>In 2000 I set up my own clinic in Vermont.  In 2004 I took on a very enthusiastic new RMIT graduate, George Demirov.  In his first week I came down with chicken pox while I was 28 weeks pregnant with my second son.  George settled into the clinic very quickly and became a very popular Osteo. I moved the clinic to Ringwood in 2008 and offered George a joint partnership and hence Fisher Demirov Osteopaths began.</p>


<p>I have a keen interest in treating pregnancy and sports related injuries.</p>


<p><strong>IN YOUR SPARE TIME YOU…</strong><b><br />
</b>I work at Fisher Demirov and also have Park Orchards Osteopathy close to home as I am a mum (taxi) to four young boys. There is not much spare time in our household however I love to watch my boys play ‘lots’ of sport.  I have now hung up my squash racquet and have switched to tennis a few times a week which I thoroughly enjoy.  I also love going to the movies, travelling and shopping!</p>


<p><strong>SOME FUN FACTS ABOUT YOU…</strong><b><br />
</b>I love ironing, I find it relaxing!</p>

<h1>Dr. Melanie Taylor</h1>

<p><strong>WHY DID YOU BECOME AN OSTEO?</strong><br />
After watching my mum struggle with painful carpal tunnel for many years, I became inspired to pursue a career in manual therapy. The holistic approach to manual medicine and principles that form the foundation of osteopathy completed the picture perfectly for me. I thoroughly enjoy being able to help people recover and get back to doing the things they love!</p>


<p><strong>WHEN DID YOU JOIN THE TEAM AT FISHER DEMIROV?</strong><br />
I graduated from Victoria University in 2011 with a Bachelor and Masters of Health Sciences (Osteopathy), and shortly after started working with George and Rach. My form of treatment has an emphasis on rehabilitation, self management and injury prevention. I really enjoy practicing my specialty in Dry Needling Therapy and Pregnancy at the clinic&#8230;especially on Georges wife!</p>


<p><strong>IN YOUR SPARE TIME YOU…</strong><br />
I have an interest in Canine Osteopathy (yes I love to practice on dogs!) and completed a post graduate diploma in Canine Osteopathy in 2012. I hope to pursue Clinical Pilates in the next few years. I enjoy swimming and spending time with my adorable niece. In between all of this, I love to travel and have new experiences around the world!</p>


<p><strong>SOME FUN FACTS ABOUT YOU…</strong><br />
I represented Australia in karate at a young age, however I have never broken a bone in my body!</p>
